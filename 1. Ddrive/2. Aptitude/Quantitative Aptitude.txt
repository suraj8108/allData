1. Numbers
		Natural Numbers 	
			-> Numbers greater than zero.
				
		Whole Numbers 
			-> Numbers greater than equal to zero
			
		Integers
			-> Includes both positive and negative numbers.
			
		Rational Numbers
			->  Rational Numbers are those numbers that can be represented in the p/q form, where p and q are both integers and q can never be 0. 
			-> 	Eg: 1/2, 3/5
			
		Irrational Numbers
			->	Number which can not be represented in p/q form.
			-> 	Eg: Root(2), pi, etc
			
		Real Numbers
			-> Collection of rational and irrational numbers.
			
		Complex Numbers
			->	It can be defined of the form a + ib,  where a and b are real numbers and “i” is the iota
		
		
		Prime Numbers:
			-> Divisible by 1 or itself.
		
		Composite Number:
			-> Number which is not prime.
		
		Co-Prime Number:
			-> Pair of numbers which has HCF as 1.
			-> Eg: 9 and 4
		
		Perfect Numbers
			-> Sum of divisors(except itself) of number equals to the given number.
			-> 6 = 1 + 2 + 3
		
2. HCF and LCM

		HCF / GCD:	
			-> Largest possible number that can divide the given numbers.
			-> Eg: HCF of 12 and 18 is 6
			
			-> Using Prime Factorization Method
				Prime factorization of 36: 2^2 × 3^2

				Prime factorization of 48: 2^4 × 3^1

				Prime factorization of 72: 2^3 × 3^2
				
				Common factors: 2^2 and 3^1 (take the minimum power)
				
				So, the HCF of 36, 48, and 72 is 2^2 × 3^1 = 12.
			
			-> Using Subtraction technique
				GCD of 96, 72:
					-> 96 - 72 = 24
				
				GCD of 120, 96:
					-> 120 – 96 = 24
			
		LCM 
			-> Smallest common multiple of a given number
			-> LDM of 4 and 6 is 12
			-> Prime Factorization Method
			
			-> Using Division Tehnique
				https://byjus.com/maths/prime-factorization-of-hcf-and-lcm/
				
				LCM of 20 and 12
					2	| 20, 12
					2	| 10, 6
					5	| 5, 3
					3	| 1, 3
						| 1, 1
				LCM =  2*2*5*3 = 60
		
		NOTE:
			HCF * LCM = Product of numbers


3. Work and Wages
		
		Work Done Formula:
			Work done = (Rate of work)  x (Time)
		
		Wages:
			-> Wages are usually proportional to the amount of work done. 
			-> If a person A completes a task in ( n ) days and earns ( W ) rupees, then the daily wage is W / n.
		
		Formula:
			Work Done = Efficiency * Time
			Combined Work Rate = Sum of Individual Work Rates
			Wages = Daily Wage * Number of Days

4. Speed, Time and Distance
		
		-> To convert from km/hour to m / sec: a Km/hr = a x (5/18) m/s
		-> To convert from m / sec to km/hour: a m/s = a x (18/5) Km/hr
		
		1. Average Speed for Varying Distances
		
			-> Speed = Distance / Time
			
		2. Average Speed for Equal Distances at Different Speeds
		
			-> Average Speed = (2 * S1 * S2)/(S1 + S2)	
			
			When to Use: 
				Use this formula when covering equal distances at two different speeds, such as going to a location at one speed and returning at another.
		
		3. Relative Speed:
				
				Same Direction:
					Relative Speed = Difference of Speeds
						Example: Two trains moving at 80 km/h and 60 km/h in the same direction:
						Relative Speed = 80 - 60 = 20 km/h
				
				Opposite Directions:
					Relative Speed = Sum of Speeds
						Example: Two trains moving at 80 km/h and 60 km/h toward each other:
						Relative Speed = 80 + 60 = 140 km/h
			
			Passing a Stationary Object: 
				* When a train passes a stationary object, the distance covered is equal to the length of the train.
			
			Train Passing a Platform: 
				* When a train passes a platform, the distance covered is the sum of the lengths of the train and the platform.

5. Pipes and Cistern
	
	Inlet & Outlet:
		* The problems of pipes and cisterns usually have two kinds of pipes, Inlet pipe, and Outlet pipe / Leak. 
		* The inlet pipe is the pipe that fills the tank/reservoir/cistern and the Outlet pipe / Leak is the one that empties it.
	
	Formulas:
		Filling and Emptying:
			-> If you need x hours to fill up a tank then part filled in 1 hr = 1/x
			-> If y hours are required to empty the tank then part emptied in 1 hour = 1/y
		
		Combined Work
			-> If one pipe can fill the tank in x hours and another can empty it in y hours (assuming y is greater than x), 
				then the net part of the tank filled in 1 hour is equal to {(xy) / (y-x)}.
			-> If one pipe can fill the tank in x hours and another can empty it in y hours (assuming x is greater than y), 
				then the net part of the tank filled in 1 hour is equal to {(xy) / (x-y)}.
		
		-> Net Work Done = (Total Sum of Work Done by Inlets) – (Total Sum of Work Done by Outlets)
		
		-> If you have two inlets that can fill a certain tank, one taking x hours and the other taking y hours respectively, 
			the total time taken to fill the tank is calculated with the formula {(xy) / (y+x)}
	
6 Boats and Streams:
	
	Upstream 
		=> Moving against the direction of the stream or current.
		=> Speed Upstream = (B - S) km / hr		--- Eq1
			B = Speed of Boat in Still Water
			S = Speed(Rate) of Stream
	
	Downstream 
		=> Moving along the direction of the stream or current.
		=> Speed Downstream = (B + S) km/hr	    --- Eq2
		
	Rate of Stream 
		=> Moving water in a river or any other water body.
		=> Equation solve - Subtract Eq1 and Eq2
				B + S - B + S = D - U
				2S = D - U
				S = (D - U) / 2
		=> Rate of stream = 0.5 × (D – U) km/hr
			D = Downward Stream speed
			U = Upward Stream speed
		
	Still Water Speed :
		=> Water in a river or any other water body that is not flowing or stationary.
		=> Speed of boat in still water = 0.5 × (D + U) km / hr


7. Percentage
	
	Percentage Formula:
		
		* Percent of a Number = Percentage/100 × Number
		* Eg: 5% of 50 is 2.5
		
	Percentage Difference Formula
		* Percentage Difference = (Absolute difference / Average) × 100
		* Eg: Percentage Difference between 50 to 100 will be 
				((100 - 50) / 0.5*(100+50))* 100 = 66.66%
	
	Percentage Increase / Decrease Formula:
		{(Final Value – Initial Value) / Initial Value} × 100 
	
	Percentage Chart:
		1/1		-> 		100%
		1/2		-> 		50%
		3/5		-> 		75%
		1/3		-> 		33.33%
		1/4		-> 		25%
		1/5		-> 		20%
		1/6		-> 		16.67%
		1/7		-> 		14.28%
		1/8		-> 		12.5%
		1/9		-> 		11.11%
		1/10	-> 		10%
	
	Percentage Trick
		=> % x of y = % y of x
