1. Similar to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), which breaks down the applications into hierarchy of objects, 
2. AOP breaks down the programs into aspects or concerns. 
3. Spring AOP module allows you to implement concerns or aspects in a Spring application in Spring AOP, the aspects are the regular Spring beans or regular 
	classes annotated with @Aspect annotation. 
4. These aspects help in transaction management and logging and failure monitoring of an application. 
5. For example, transaction management is required in bank operations such as transferring an amount from one account to another Spring AOP module provides a 
	transaction management abstraction layer that can be applied to transaction APIs.

Aspect Orienter Programming:
	
	=> Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm that aims to increase modularity by allowing the separation of cross-cutting concerns. 
	=> Cross-cutting concerns are aspects of a program that affect multiple components, such as logging, security, and transaction management. 
	=> AOP helps in adding additional behavior to existing code without modifying the code itself.
